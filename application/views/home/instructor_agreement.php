Any dispute, conflict, claim or controversy arising out of or broadly in connection with or relating to these Agreement, including those relating to its validity, its construction or its enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can be referred to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules' Emergency Arbitrator provisions are excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by three (3) arbitrators. LYVYO shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, the Instructor shall appoint one (1) arbitrator and the two arbitrators can jointly appoint the third arbitrator. The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings, including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence from and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from the mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from the other party unless: (I) the disclosure to the third party is reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or arbitration proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally in writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated herein.</p>

            <p class="py-md-1">4. The Vienna Convention on the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG) shall not apply.</p>

            <p class="py-md-1">5. The seat as well as the venue of the arbitration at all times shall be Dubai.</p>

            <p class="py-md-1">6. All proceedings, including issuance of an arbitration award, in any such arbitration, shall be conducted in English.</p>

            <p class="py-md-1">7. The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the Parties, and may be enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

            <p class="py-md-1">8. The Parties agree to bear their own costs of arbitration until such time that the arbitral tribunal does not pass an award deciding on the costs. The arbitrators may, (but shall not be required to), award to a Party that substantially prevails on merits, its costs and reasonable expenses (including reasonable fees of its counsel).</p>

            <p class="py-md-1">9. When any dispute is under arbitration, the Parties shall continue to exercise their remaining respective rights and fulfil their remaining respective obligations under this Agreement.</p>

            <p class="py-md-2">2. Notwithstanding anything contained herein, LYVYO reserves the right to assign and all of its rights, duties, obligations and liabilities under this Agreement. For clarification of doubt, it is hereby stated that nothing in this Clause and/or this Agreement shall provide the Instructor with any right, be it in the form of an affirmative vote or otherwise, at the instance of a Liquidation Event. The Parties shall execute such documents as may be necessary or desirable to give effect to such assignment.</p>


            <h5 class="font-dubai-bold pt-md-2 ">14. CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>

            <p class="">3. Nothing in this Clause 14 shall be applicable in relation to the Instructor disclosing his association with LYVYO on his online social media profiles.</p>


            <h5 class="font-dubai-bold pt-md-2 ">15. SEVERABILITY</h5>
            <p class="">Any provision in this Agreement, which is or may become prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in the same or any other jurisdiction. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Parties will immediately negotiate in good faith to replace such provision with a proviso, which is not prohibited or unenforceable and has, as far as possible, the same legal and commercial effect as that which it replaces.</p>

            <h5 class="font-dubai-bold pt-md-2 ">16. AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS</h5>
            <p class="">Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment by each of the Parties, or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver by any Party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be cumulative and not alternative.</p>

            <h5 class="font-dubai-bold pt-md-2 ">17. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS</h5>
            <p class="">The Parties are independent contracting parties and will have no power or authority to assume or create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of each other. This Agreement will not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture, or employer-employee relationship.</p>


            <p class="">This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the transactions envisaged under this Agreement and the inter-se rights and obligations of the Parties, superseding and replacing all negotiations, prior agreements, discussions, memoranda or heads of agreements, made prior to the date hereof amongst the Parties.</p>
